# Number Guessing Game with PyScript

## Description
This project is a crude reimagination of the original [MDN Learning Area's Number Guessing Game](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/first-splash/number-guessing-game-start.html) as a PyScript learning exercise, which has been rebuilt using PyScript instead of JavaScript. The game logic has been slightly modified to offer a different experience:

- Players have 4 guesses instead of the original number of guesses.
- The range of numbers to guess is now between 1 and 10.
- These can be further customized in the python class GuessGame if needed

## Libraries Used
- random
- pyodide
